Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression Welcome to the house price prediction project repository! This project was successfully done during my
internship at Prodigy, where I used a linear regression model to estimate property prices based on square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms.
Project Overview The purpose of this project was to create a predictive model that could reliably anticipate house prices based on essential characteristics
such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms and also some additional features like lot size, fireplace , age etc. 
This assignment requires data pretreatment, model development, and evaluation to assure correctness and reliability.
Key Tasks and Achievements Data collection and cleaning: Collected housing data from credible sources and cleaned it to remove missing numbers and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to better understand the relationships between variables, uncover patterns, and obtain insights into the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Improved model performance by creating essential characteristics such as total area (combining the square footage of all rooms).
Model Development: Built a linear regression model with Python and machine learning frameworks like Scikit-Learn.
Model Evaluation: To analyze the model's predictive ability, we used measures like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
